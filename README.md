# Pinto WordPress Theme

Pinto is a delicate & delightfully lightweight theme built for writers, journalists & photographers. It's a seductively minimal WordPress theme that takes just minutes to get running.

## Development

1. Clone this GitHub repository.
2. Browse to the folder in the command line.
3. Run the `npm install` command to install the theme's development dependencies within a /node_modules/ folder.
4. Add an environment.json to the theme root directory with a key of `devURL` and a value of your local install.

Example: 
```
{
    "devURL": "http://demo.dev/pinto"
}
```
4. Run the `npm start` command for development.
5. Run the `build` gulp task to process build files and generate a zip.
